# Project Description
This Project is based on the implementation of Blockchain in real time environment with the help of JavaScript. This project contains the implementaion of Blockchain algorithms like Proof of Work and Consensus Algorithms. We have also implemented varios Blockchain features like distributed ledger ,decentralised network with the help of Node.js and exposed them as API's. So if you are begineer looking to learn the Blockchain Technology then this is a perfect begineer's project to follow along.

# API'S
We have implemented varios endpoints in the network.js file. And the various endpoint descriptions are:-
### 1. '/transaction'
This is the Post API whose work is to take the new transaction data and add it to the pending transactions object in our Blockchain DataStructure and return the current content of the Blockchain.
### 2. '/transaction/broadcast'
This is also a Post API, That is used to broadcast the updated transaction to all the network nodes connected with each other and uses the javaScript promisies to bind the all the request into and array and send it.
### 3. '/mine' 
This is
